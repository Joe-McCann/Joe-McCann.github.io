  - title: The purpose
    text: |
      This code was written and created for an extra credit project in high school. The program was designed
      to take basic hex assembly code from the PIC microcontroller, and reconvert it back in to "English"
      assembly code.

  - title: What's so cool about this?
    text: |
      This code was pretty cool because I was able to take hex files that we used from our own
      class assembly projects, and convert them back into assembly code. While certainly not the most
      glamorous of the projects I've created, it was interesting to create a parser that would read through
      the hex file and determine which command was which. This was all in line with the command
      documentation provided by the PIC microcontroller data-sheets
