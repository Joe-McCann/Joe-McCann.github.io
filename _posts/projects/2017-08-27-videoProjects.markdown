  - title: The purpose
    text: |
      I've always found that I have a minor side-passion when it comes to video editing. A good skill
      in video editing can create so many cool things for several different occasions. Other than
      that mainly I just do these sorts of projects for fun!
  - title: What's so cool about this?
    text: |
      By using programs such Adobe Premiere, I was able to stitch together all sorts of
      different clips to create fun videos. The best video I created was my send off
      video for my high school class, entitled "4 Years at the Academy [End Credits]".
