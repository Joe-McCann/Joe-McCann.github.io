  - title: The purpose
    text: |
      Inspired by a superbowl commercial a few years back, I always wanted to create a way to
      have lights and colors follow the flow and feel of given musical pieces. Originally created
      as a senior capstone project for high school, I redesigned it in Python using new knowledge
      I had aqcuired in my first college semester. As for the bigger purpose, I just thought the
      listening experience would be enhanced by having a single light grow or decay in relation to
      what you were hearing (it is).
  - title: What's so cool about this?
    text: |
      This program is literally my pride in joy. Having tinkered with it for weeks on end, I learned
      about a plethora of new libraries and methods, such as numpy, tkinter, colorsys, serial, etc.
      The project originally read through the entire song at once to come up with the optimal light (in HSL)
      value to display. However this took much too long, so I created my own way to calculate an estimated
      version of this on the fly. From there I learned how to use the tkinter library such that I could
      create a GUI to select a certain song.
