    text: |
      Project Euler problems combine my two passions, computer science and mathematics. This should
      come as no surprise to anyone who knows me, as these two topics are both of my intended majors
      at NJIT. As such I have a fun time working on and solving these problems, as my very own personal
      challenges, along with some friends of mine (who I may or may not compete with â˜º)
  - title: What's so cool about this?
    text: |
      Over the course of (currently) 65 solved problems, I have learned many new techniques in Python;
      the language I have been using to complete the problems. Also, by completing 65 problems, I am
      currently in the 96th percentile of Project Euler problems. I have also learned about several
      mathematical concepts and algorithms as well, which have found use in other projects.
