  - title: The purpose
    text: |
      One day a group of friends and I were just hanging out and having a bunch of dumb fun on the
      <a href="https://www.lovecalculator.com/"> Love Calculator Website </a>. While just jokingly inputting the names of some our friends,
      we noticed that the calculator did not seem to work with a bunch of our Indian friend's names. There also
      seemed to be a distinguishable pattern with the values that the calculator gave out. I then set out to make my
      own version that would work with not only any name, but would also provide a unique value determined by both inputs.

      The application was styled using JavaFX and CSS stylesheets to make it look better than a set of plain text boxes.
      In order to make the application work for any potential combination of names, and spit out a answer dependant
      on those inputs, the names were converted into sets of numbers. From there some matrix calculations are
      performed to come up with the correct output number.
