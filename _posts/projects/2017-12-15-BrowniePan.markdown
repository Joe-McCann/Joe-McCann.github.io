    text: |
      This project was created as my MATH 227 (Mathematical Modeling) final, along with four other group members. As my portion of the project, I wrote this piece of software that would model the "effectiveness" of a brownie pan in terms of its wasted space in the oven, and how effectively heat is evenly distributed amoung the pan.

    text: |
      This project can do several calculations on generic functions. While there are restrictions about what functions can and cannot be used (mentioned in the readme), there are a very large and comprehensize list of those that can. 
      Most impressive, however, is the heat modeling portion. While most heat modeling systems use a set of partial differential equations, which take lots of time an resources, I was able to adequately model the heat eminating from the pan using simple calculus. While not lightning fast, this alogirthm works fairly quickly, and produces good results
