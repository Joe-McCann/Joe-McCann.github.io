  - title: The purpose
    text: |
      Finals week is every student's worst nightmare; whether you are in college, or high school. With so much on the line,
      sometimes a student wants to know exactly how well they have to do on a certain test, in order to make their
      own benchmark. This is where the final exam grade calculator comes in handy.

  - title: What's so cool about this?
    text: |
      Every class is different, so I wanted to create flexibility with the program, such that the code wouldn't
      need to be modified each time it's used for a different class. This was accomplished using arrays of input elements,
      i.e. the row of text boxes. From there the program not only calculates what grade will happen for every final
      score multiple of 5, but also where that lands in relation to the students target grade.
