          <h6 class=project_Lang>Edited in Adobe Premiere</h6>
          <p class=project_Desc>Using video clips taken throughout the entire
          final year of high school, I stitched together a farewell video to commorate
          all of my classmates. I modeled the video in the style of an end credits scene
          from a movie. I learned so much about using Adobe Premiere with this project, that
          I am now comfotable using it for other projects.</p>

          <p class=project_Desc>Have you ever used C++ and been irritated by how the biggest
            number you could come up with was from an <i>unsigned long long int</i>, which
            maxes out at 18,446,744,073,709,551,616? Well then use my C++ Big class! By using
            vectors I was able to rewrite basic digit-wise mathematical operators, such that you
            you could easily integrate it into your own code!</p>

        <h6 class=project_Lang>Written in JavaFX</h6>
        <p class=project_Desc>When finals week is approaching, somethimes you want to figure out
        just how well you need to do in order to get a certain grade in a class. Well there are many
        calculators that will do it for you, but I made one myself! This calculator allows you to weigh
        your grades in any way, as to allow flixibility for any professor's style. The program will also
        calculate exactly what you need on your final to hit the target grade!</p>
