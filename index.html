<div>
  <p id=short_Bio>Over the course of several years I have accumulated a vast amount of programs.<br>
    Each one has been its own working experience, and taught me valuable lessons, <br>
    while being a fun task!</br></br></p>

    <h3 class=project_Name>Big Integer Class</h3>
    <h6 class=project_Lang>Written in C++</h6>
    <p class=project_Desc>Have you ever used C++ and been irritated by how the biggest<br>
      number you could come up with was from an <i>unsigned long long int</i>, which <br>
      maxes out at 18,446,744,073,709,551,616? Well then use my C++ Big class! By using <br>
      vectors I was able to rewrite basic digit-wise mathematical operators, such that you<br>
      you could easily integrate it into your own code!</br></br></br></br></p>
