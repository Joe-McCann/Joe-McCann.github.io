      <p id=short_Bio>Over the course of several years I have accumulated a vast amount of programs.<br>
        Each one has been its own working experience, and taught me valuable lessons, <br>
        while being a fun task!</p>

        <h3 class=project_Name>Big Integer Class</h3>
        <h6 class=project_Lang>Written in C++</h6>
        <p class=project_Desc>Have you ever used C++ and been irritated by how the biggest<br>
          number you could come up with was from an <i>unsigned long long int</i>, which <br>
          maxes out at 18,446,744,073,709,551,616? Well then use my C++ Big class! By using <br>
          vectors I was able to rewrite basic digit-wise mathematical operators, such that you<br>
          you could easily integrate it into your own code!</p>

        <h6 class=project_Lang>Written in JavaFX</h6>
        <p class=project_Desc>When finals week is approaching, somethimes you want to figure out<br>
        just how well you need to do in order to get a certain grade in a class. Well there are many<br>
        calculators that will do it for you, but I made one myself! This calculator allows you to weigh<br>
        your grades in any way, as to allow flixibility for any professor's style. The program will also<br>
        calculate exactly what you need on your final to hit the target grade!</p>
